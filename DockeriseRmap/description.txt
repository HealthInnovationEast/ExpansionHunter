Run with:
docker run --rm -v /workspaces/ExpansionHunter/results:/results:ro -v /workspaces/ExpansionHunter/results:/results2:rw -ti <Image ID>

where results is the location of the current data (will be mentioned in A, C, D and E)

Then:
cd ../..
bgzip -c results/repeats.vcf > workdir/repeats.vcf.gz
tabix -p vcf workdir/repeats.vcf.gz
touch workdir/annot.hdr
Rscript mapV3.r results/repeats.txt results/repeats_realigned.bam workdir/repeats.vcf results/multi_str.txt workdir/ results2/ repeats


cd ../..
bgzip -c ${A} > ${B}.gz
tabix -p vcf ${B}.gz
touch ${B}/annot.hdr
Rscript mapV3.r ${C} ${D} ${A*} ${E} ${B} ${F} ${G}

${A} - VCF file with path - results/repeats.vcf
${A*} - VCF file but with workdir path - workdir/repeats.vcf
${B} - folder for intermediates - workdir/
${C} - variants details list text file with path (example from J) - results/repeats.txt
${D} - BAM file with path - results/repeats_realigned.bam
${E} - text file with list of exclusions with path- results/multi_str.txt
${F} - outdir -  results2/
${G} - root string for output - repeats
